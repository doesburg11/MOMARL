# Multi-Objective Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning Experiments

## Resource Gathering (MORL)
Starting point for this project is [resource gathering](https://github.com/doesburg11/SurvivalReproduction/blob/main/MO_Gymnasium/resource_gathering/mpmoq_policy.py), a modification of a [morl-baselines](https://github.com/LucasAlegre/morl-baselines) example. This is a multi-objective single agent solution.
